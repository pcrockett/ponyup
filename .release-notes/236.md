## Fixed ponyup-init.sh crash when specifying --prefix

When running `ponyup-init.sh` with the `--prefix` parameter, the script would crash because the `ponyup` invocation at the end of the script wasn't running with the same prefix. This minor change fixes that by also running `ponyup` with the `--prefix` parameter.`
